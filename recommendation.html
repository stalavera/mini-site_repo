            <h4><em><u>Amazing</u></em><br></h4>
            This is such a fantastic book. I originally got interested in reading it after the movie trailer came out, and oh boy did it exceed my expectations! I read within 48 hours! (Never happens) Fast paced, short chapters and so much juicy story telling. Such a good mystery thriller!!!<br><br>
            <h4><em><u>Perfect Thriller</u></em><br></h4>
            A great book for anyone looking to get back into reading mysteries or books in general. While it might seem like a run-of-the-mill domestic thriller, McFadden did in fact keep me guessing until the end.<br><br>
            <h4><em><u>Kept me in suspense the whole time</u></em><br></h4>
            This book kept me in suspense and interested in continuing reading from the moment I started it. I couldn't stop reading it, l needed to have the answers I was looking for, and I didn't stop until I finished it. I liked everything about the book; ok maybe there's something small I didn't like, I would have liked the answers to my "why" to have been explained more fully in the end, since the ending was a bit abrupt in my opinion, other than that it was excellent.

                                <h4><em><u>Bunny Mayhem</u></em><br></h4>
                                Mona Awad is a treasure when it comes to creating stories full of satire, obsession, horror, dark humor and speculative premises. We Love You, Bunny - well this will meet and exceed all expectations of an over-the-top literary romp just chock full of lunacy and whimsy. I am not sure if this would have been a book I would have picked up if not for all the chatter and how much everyone loved Bunny. You don't need to read Bunny to enjoy this masterpiece. Frankenstein meets Heathers the book jacket states - YES PLEASE!<br><br>
                                <h4><em><u>The Bunnies are baaaaa-aaack</u></em><br></h4>      
                                Was thrilled when I head that Mona Awad was writing a sequel to Bunny, her sharp, subversive (and slightly sinister) novel about friendship and ambition and imagination. This sequel delivers, with higher stakes, as the bunnies tell their side of the story. Couldn't put this one down, and really did not want it to end.<br><br>
                                <h4><em><u>Go down the rabbit hole again</u></em><br></h4>
                                'm so happy that Mona Awad has brought us back to the world of Warren University and the bunnies. Weirder, wilder, and bigger in scope, We Love You, Bunny will delight the legions of fans of Bunny, but it can also be read as a standalone novel. Don't miss this one, k bunny?

                                <h4><em><u>Jane Goodall is a good person</u></em><br></h4>
                                This book got me to think about animals and the enviroment. Chimpanzees are interesting animals. Good read if you like nature.<br><br>
                                <h4><em><u>Awesome</u></em><br></h4>
                                This book is awesome. Best atobiography ever.<br><br>
                                <h4><em><u>Everyone knows that feeling of success, victory, or accomplishm</u></em><br></h4>
                                Everyone knows that feeling of success, victory, or accomplishment; you start to sprout out of that hard shell and face towards the warmth of the beaming, bright light of the horizon. Two things I liked about the book, was how she used a man who studied and cared for ducks as a hook. The other thing that I like about Jane Goodall&amp;rsquo;s memoir: My Life with the Chimpanzees, was how she expressed how the wild chimpanzees piqued her interest, and this made her want to know more. One thing that I disliked was how she gave the chimpanzees weird names. 
                                I would recommend other readers to read My Life with the Chimpanzees by Jane Goodall, because she has an interesting childhood history and adventure as an adult.
                                 However, I would especially highly recommend it to readers who like animals and adventure.
