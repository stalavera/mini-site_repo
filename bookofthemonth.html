                        <strong>INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER!</strong><br><br>
                        Sybil Delling has spent nine years dreaming of having no dreams at all. Like the other foundling girls who traded a decade of service for a home in the great cathedral, Sybil is a Diviner. In her dreams she receives visions from six unearthly figures known as Omens. From them, she can predict terrible things before they occur, and lords and common folk alike travel across the kingdom of Traum’s windswept moors to learn their futures by her dreams.<br><br>
Just as she and her sister Diviners near the end of their service, a mysterious knight arrives at the cathedral. Rude, heretical, and devilishly handsome, the knight Rodrick has no respect for Sybil's visions. But when Sybil's fellow Diviners begin to vanish one by one, she has no choice but to seek his help in finding them. For the world outside the cathedral’s cloister is wrought with peril. Only the gods have the answers she is seeking, and as much as she'd rather avoid Rodrick's dark eyes and sharp tongue, only a heretic can defeat a god.<br><br>
<strong>From New York Times bestselling author Rachel Gillig comes the next big romantasy sensation, a gothic, mist-cloaked tale of a young prophetess forced on an impossible quest with the one knight whose future is beyond her sight. Perfect for fans of Jennifer L. Armentrout and Leigh Bardugo.</strong>
                        <h4><em><u>Gods, Dreams, & Duty</u></em><br></h4>
                        Rachel Gillig packs a mist-cloaked punch in her new release 'The Knight and the Moth.' Gillig makes the fantasy space feel refreshing and new, while dealing with heavier themes of death, identity, and religion among them. Balancing this with comedic relief one-liners and characters that make you feel at home; you'll be pacing around endlessly for her next book in your hands.
